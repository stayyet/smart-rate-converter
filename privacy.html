    <h1>Privacy Policy for SmartRate Converter</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: [June 3, 2025]</p>

    <p>Thank you for using SmartRate Converter (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains what information the Extension collects, uses, and how it is handled.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
    <p>The SmartRate Converter extension is designed with your privacy in mind. We aim to collect as little information as possible to provide and improve the service.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Data Stored Locally on Your Device:</h3>
    <p>The following data is stored exclusively on your local computer within the Chrome browser's storage for this extension. This data is not transmitted to us or any third party unless explicitly stated (e.g., API key to the API provider).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided API Key (Optional):</strong> If you choose to enter your own API key for the ExchangeRate-API service, this key is stored locally in your browser's storage. It is only used to make requests directly from your browser to the ExchangeRate-API service as per your configuration. We do not see, collect, or store your personal API key on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Settings such as your preferred display language (e.g., English or Chinese) and preferred number of decimal places for displaying conversion results are stored locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Favorites:</strong> Your saved favorite currency pairs are stored locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversion History:</strong> A list of your recent currency conversions is stored locally for your convenience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This locally stored data is used solely to enhance your experience with the Extension by remembering your preferences and providing quick access to frequently used features.</p>

    <h3>2. Network Requests:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>ExchangeRate-API Service:</strong> To provide currency conversion rates, the Extension makes requests to the ExchangeRate-API service (<code>https://v6.exchangerate-api.com</code>). These requests include:
            <ul>
                <li>The base currency you are converting from.</li>
                <li>An API key (either the Extension's default key or your user-provided key if you have configured one).</li>
            </ul>
            The data returned by ExchangeRate-API is used to display conversion rates and results within the Extension. We do not control the data collection or privacy practices of ExchangeRate-API. We recommend you review their privacy policy available on their website.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Data We Do Not Collect:</h3>
    <p>We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) beyond what is mentioned above. We do not track your browsing activity, your IP address (beyond what is standard for any web request to the API provider), or any other personal data.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>While the data is stored locally on your device, please be mindful of the security of your own computer and browser. If you provide your own API key, its security is also your responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Extension relies on ExchangeRate-API for currency data. Their service has its own terms of service and privacy policy, which we encourage you to review.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension or on its Chrome Web Store page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: ljfstayyet@gmail.com</p>
